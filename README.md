This is the README for instructions on how to run our project. 

## Stage 1 Code (Object Detection + OCR):

We attached weights for our Object Detection Model in the submission for our code. Our Stage 1 Code is in a .ipynb notebook in Google Colab called CS473_ObjectDetection_OCR.ipynb

To run our Stage 1 Code, you can run the notebook from top to bottom, but you will have to change file paths to point to the correct paths for images folders and the weights which we provided. We used google drive for our file repo. 


## Stage 2 Code (Prediction Model given Stage 1 output):

To run our Stage 2 Code, you must run the notebook from top to bottom since methods 2 and 3 depend on lines in method 1. Again, you will have to change the file paths for the files that are in Google Drive.
